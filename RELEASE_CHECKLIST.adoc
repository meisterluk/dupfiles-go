Release checklist
=================
author:: meisterluk

Before publishing a new release, I should check the following list:

Toolchain
---------

• Update your software stack to the latest Golang toolchain.

Code quality
------------

• New bug fixes contained? Test cases needed.
• All functions and structs have a proper documentation
• All functions and structs have appropriate visibility (first letter is lowercase/uppercase)
• Run “report” and “find” after “go build -race …” to catch trivial concurrency bugs

Concurrency checks
------------------

• WaitGroup.Add(n) is always called before generating the goroutine
• if one goroutine B waits for data of another goroutine A, we need to make sure that A does not terminate prematurely without stopping operation of B
