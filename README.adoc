What is it about?
-----------------

We compute hashes for files and directories.
This allows easy remote comparison of file system nodes.

Why should I use it?
--------------------

Because you/your OS screwed up your filesystem.
I have partial backups of my data, but lost track which backups are complete (and so on).
Thus I want to identify duplicate nodes in these backups.

Who should use it?
------------------

Anyone storing data on computers. System administrators in particular.

How to install
--------------

1. Go to link:https://github.com/meisterluk/dupfiles-go/releases[Releases] to download the archive appropriate for your platform (in case of doubt: `windows_64-bit.tar.gz`)
2. Decompress the archive and find `dupfiles-go.exe` (filename is `dupfiles-go` for UNIX-like platforms)
3. Set the executable bit for the binary (Windows: right-click on the file and go the permissions, UNIX-like: `chmod a+x dupfiles-go`)
4. Move `dupfiles-go.exe` into a folder mentioned in the `PATH` environment variable or extend `PATH` to the desired path (in case of doubt move it to `C:\Windows\System32`)
5. Open a terminal (Windows: Press Ctrl-R, type ‚Äúcmd.exe‚Äù and Enter) and run `dupfiles-go.exe version` (Windows) or `dupfiles-go` (UNIX-like)
6. If the output starts with `dupfiles ` and some version number, then installation succeeded.

On the other hand, if you install the link:https://golang.org/doc/install[Golang toolchain],
you can build the dupfiles-go executable yourself. First, run `go get`:

[source,bash]
go get github.com/meisterluk/dupfiles-go

and optionally start developing! üòä You can build the executable using:

[source,base]
go build github.com/meisterluk/dupfiles-go/cli

How to run
----------

For a comprehensive documentation, please take a look at the link:https://github.com/meisterluk/dupfiles-go/tree/master/doc[design paper].
For quickstart examples, you have these options:

1. `dupfiles report .` generates a report for the current directory. Creates a `report.fsr` file.
2. `dupfiles report .. -o parent.fsr` generates a report for the parent directory. Creates a `parent.fsr` file.
3. `dupfiles find report.dup parent.fsr` describes the differences between both directories. It will describe the current directory as occuring in the parent directory.

Or you can compute the hash value of one specific directory:

1. `dupfiles hash .`

As you can see, I have bound the `v1` API import to the alias `dup` which is best practice.
